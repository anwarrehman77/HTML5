<h1 class= "intro">The Journey of a Programmer</h1>
<p class= "intro">A few months ago my mom told me to study math on the computer and as usual I make an excuse. But she figured it out and I started studying but I found projects and it had a link to programming and so it started.</p>
<a href= "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming">To learn about programming click here</a>
<p class= "story">I clicked on intro into Drawing and Animations and after a few months I went to Making webpages
P.S. If you're hacker "May the force be with you" & "teach me". So first I started my html with tagging, then I went on to "CSS".
</p><br />
<p class="story">The first thing I learned is how to do plain typing, then I learned how to do CSS by coloring everything.</p>
